# OpenSign Deployment — `docsign.bettersign.ing`

**Status:** ✅ Live · **Deployed:** 2026-10-06 · **Owner:** brendon@ixiomsoftware.com

A self-hosted [OpenSign](https://github.com/OpenSignLabs/OpenSign) (open-source DocuSign
alternative) running as a split frontend/backend across **Cloudflare** and **Fly.io**.

---

## 1. Live endpoints

| Piece | URL | Platform |
|---|---|---|
| **Frontend (app UI) — canonical** | https://docsign.bettersign.ing | Cloudflare Workers (Static Assets) |
| ↳ alias | https://opensign.bettersign.ing → **301 redirects** to docsign (Page Rule) | Cloudflare |
| **Backend API** (Parse Server) | https://docsign-bettersign-api.fly.dev | Fly.io (Docker) |
| **Database** (MongoDB) | `docsign-bettersign-mongo.internal:27017` (private, no public IP) | Fly.io (Docker) |
| **BetterSign** signing coordinator | https://bs-opensign-sign.brendonp.workers.dev (separate `bs-opensign` project) | Cloudflare Worker + Durable Object |

> **docsign.bettersign.ing is the single canonical URL.** The BetterSign Worker's CORS
> `ALLOWED_ORIGIN` is `https://docsign.bettersign.ing`, so phone-signing/login only work
> from that origin — `opensign.bettersign.ing` 301-redirects to it so every entry point
> lands on the working domain.

Health checks:
- `curl https://docsign.bettersign.ing/` → app shell (HTTP 200)
- `curl https://docsign-bettersign-api.fly.dev/` → `opensign-server is running !!!`
- `curl https://docsign-bettersign-api.fly.dev/app/health` → `{"status":"ok"}`

## 2. Architecture

```

**Why the frontend talks to `*.fly.dev` directly (not a branded API subdomain):**
Fly auto-provisions valid TLS for `*.fly.dev`. A branded two-level host like
`api.docsign.bettersign.ing` is **not** covered by Cloudflare's universal cert
(`*.bettersign.ing` only covers one label deep), which would need Advanced Certificate
Manager or a Fly custom-domain cert. For a test this adds failure points with no
functional benefit. The backend sends open CORS (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`), so the
cross-origin call from `docsign.bettersign.ing` → `docsign-bettersign-api.fly.dev` works.
See §7 for how to move to a branded API host later.

## 3. Key decisions & rationale

| Decision | Why |
|---|---|
| **Frontend on Cloudflare, backend on Fly** (not all-Cloudflare) | OpenSign's backend is a stateful **Parse Server** (Node + MongoDB) that does PDF generation and cryptographic signing itself. It is **not** a thin proxy to a third-party signature API, so it cannot run in a Cloudflare Worker (V8 isolate: no Node built-ins, no persistent Mongo socket, 50 ms CPU cap on free). |
| **Not Cloudflare D1 / KV for the database** | D1 is **SQLite** reachable only *inside* a Worker; Parse Server's adapters are **MongoDB** or Postgres. There is no D1/SQLite adapter and no external driver path. D1 also can't *run* the Node server — it's only storage. Volume was never the blocker; **compatibility** was. |
| **Fly.io over Railway / CF Containers** for the backend | Fly runs the existing Dockerfile directly, has **no platform floor** (Railway = $5/mo min; CF Containers needs Workers Paid $5/mo), and is the cheapest always-on option (~$3–6/mo). |
| **MongoDB self-hosted on Fly** (not MongoDB Atlas M0) | Keeps everything inside one Fly org/private network with the credentials already available; no extra third-party account needed. Atlas M0 (free) remains a drop-in alternative to shave ~$3/mo — see §7. |
| **Cloudflare Workers Static Assets** (not legacy Pages) | The `cf` CLI only supports the current model (`cf deploy`), which is Pages' successor. Same free tier, same global edge, plus SPA routing via `not_found_handling`. |
| **Local file storage (`USE_LOCAL=TRUE`) on a Fly volume** | No S3/R2 credentials needed to get running. Documents persist on the `opensign_files` volume. Trade-off and the R2 upgrade path in §6/§7. |
| **Email disabled** | OpenSign starts fine without Mailgun/SMTP (`verifyUserEmails:false`). No mail credentials were available. Password-reset / verification / "document ready" emails are **off** until configured (§7). |

## 4. Component details

### 4.1 Frontend — Cloudflare Worker `docsign`
- **Source:** `apps/OpenSign` (Vite + React 19, `BrowserRouter`).
- **Build:** `npm run build` → `apps/OpenSign/build/` (static assets, ~34 MB).
- **Build-time env** (`apps/OpenSign/.env`, baked into the bundle):
  - `REACT_APP_SERVERURL=https://docsign-bettersign-api.fly.dev/app`
  - `REACT_APP_APPID=<APP_ID>` (must equal the backend `APP_ID`)
- **Deploy config:** `deploy/cloudflare-frontend/` (`cloudflare.config.ts`, `wrangler.config.ts`, `package.json`).
- **SPA routing:** `assets.notFoundHandling = "single-page-application"` so deep links / refreshes return `index.html` (verified: `/form/abc123` → 200).
- **Custom domains:** `domains: ["docsign.bettersign.ing", "opensign.bettersign.ing"]` in `cloudflare.config.ts` — both serve the same Worker; Cloudflare created the DNS records + edge certs automatically. The `*.workers.dev` preview URL is **disabled**. (The baked-in API URL is domain-agnostic and CORS is open, so no rebuild is needed to add frontend domains.)

### 4.2 Backend — Fly app `docsign-bettersign-api`
- **Source:** `apps/OpenSignServer` (Parse Server 8).
- **Image:** `apps/OpenSignServer/Dockerfile` (node:22.14.0 + LibreOffice; ~693 MB).
- **Config:** `apps/OpenSignServer/fly.toml` — region `sjc`, 1× `shared-cpu-1x` / 1 GB, `auto_stop_machines="off"`, `min_machines_running=1`, HTTP health check on `/`.
- **Volume:** `opensign_files` (1 GB) mounted at `/usr/src/app/files` (uploaded documents).
- **Secrets (Fly):** `APP_ID`, `MASTER_KEY`, `MONGODB_URI`, `SERVER_URL`.
- **Non-secret env (fly.toml):** `PARSE_MOUNT=/app` (⚠️ must stay `/app` — `cloudServerUrl` is hardcoded to `localhost:8080/app`), `USE_LOCAL=TRUE`, `PORT=8080`.
- **DB migrations** run automatically on boot (verified: "Successfully run migrations.").

### 4.3 Database — Fly app `docsign-bettersign-mongo`
- **Image:** `mongo:7`, launched as `mongod --bind_ip_all --ipv6 --auth`.
  - ⚠️ `--ipv6` is **required**: Fly's private network (`.internal`) is IPv6-only; without it the backend got `ECONNREFUSED` on `[…]:27017`.
- **Config:** `deploy/fly-mongo/fly.toml` — region `sjc`, 1× `shared-cpu-1x` / 512 MB.
- **Volume:** `mongo_data` (1 GB) at `/data/db`. Daily snapshots, 5-day retention (Fly default).
- **Auth:** root user from `MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME/PASSWORD` (Fly secrets). No public IP — only reachable within the Fly org's private network.

## 5. Expected costs

Free: Cloudflare Workers Static Assets (frontend) — unlimited bandwidth, 100k Worker
requests/day free; static asset responses don't count against that. **$0/mo.**

Fly.io (billed to the `gtc6244@gmail.com` Fly account), always-on:

| Resource | Spec | ~Monthly |
|---|---|---|
| Backend compute | `shared-cpu-1x`, 1 GB RAM, always on | ~$5.70 |
| Backend volume | 1 GB | ~$0.15 |
| Mongo compute | `shared-cpu-1x`, 512 MB RAM, always on | ~$3.20 |
| Mongo volume | 1 GB | ~$0.15 |
| **Total (Fly)** | | **≈ $9.20/mo** |

Plus metered bandwidth (pennies at test volume). Figures are Fly's pay-as-you-go rates as
of Jan 2026 and drift over time; watch https://fly.io/dashboard for actuals.

**Cost levers** (see §7): enable `auto_stop_machines` on the backend (→ near-$0 when idle,
at the cost of ~10–30 s cold starts) and/or replace the Mongo app with **MongoDB Atlas M0
(free)** to drop to **≈ $5.85/mo**.

## 6. Ramifications & limitations (read before real use)

1. **This is a test-grade deployment, not production-hardened.**
2. **Single backend instance, no redundancy.** One machine; if it restarts, there's a brief outage. Parse boot + migrations take ~30 s.
3. **File storage is a single Fly volume.** Uploaded/generated documents live only on `opensign_files` (mounted at `/usr/src/app/files`). The mount shadows the repo's email templates, so the Dockerfile seeds them back at startup (see item 5). Volume snapshots exist (5-day) but there's no off-site backup.
4. **MongoDB is self-managed.** Snapshots are Fly's defaults (daily, 5-day). No point-in-time recovery, no replica set. For anything you care about, add external backups or move to Atlas.
5. **Email: Resend via SMTP — verified & delivering (2026-10-06).** Sending via `smtp.resend.com:465`, user `resend`, from `no-reply@send.bettersign.ing`. The sending subdomain `send.bettersign.ing` is **verified** in Resend (DKIM+SPF records in Cloudflare DNS). End-to-end test confirmed: OpenSign `sendmailv3` → Resend → **delivered** to `brendonp@ixiomsoftware.com` (a first test to `brendon@ixiomsoftware.com` hard-bounced — that mailbox doesn't exist; the real one has the `p`). The Fly volume shadowed the email templates, so the Dockerfile now **seeds** `files_seed/` → `./files` at startup (non-clobbering); verified present on the volume. No DMARC record was added — consider adding one before high-volume sending.
6. **Document signing certificate is a self-signed DEMO cert.** `PFX_BASE64` / `PASS_PHRASE` are set (CN=`OpenSign Demo Signer`, ~825-day validity, node-forge-verified). Signatures will be cryptographically valid but **not trusted** by Adobe/OS trust stores — replace with a CA-issued (e.g. AATL) cert for anything real.
7. **Secrets were auto-generated; `MASTER_KEY` was rotated 2026-10-06.** `APP_ID`, `MASTER_KEY`, the Mongo password, and the signing cert/passphrase are saved to `DEPLOYMENT-SECRETS.local.txt` (gitignored, `chmod 600`). The `MASTER_KEY` grants full data access — keep it safe.
8. **Open CORS (`*`) on the backend.** Fine for a test; for production, lock the backend to the known frontend origin.
9. **No rate limiting / WAF** in front of the Fly backend (the frontend benefits from Cloudflare's edge, the API does not — it's hit directly).
10. **`cf` is a beta CLI.** The deploy flow is config-file driven (`cloudflare.config.ts` + `wrangler.config.ts`); quirks are documented in §8.
11. **Document upload "body stream is locked" — root cause was a Parse SDK bug exposed by the split-origin setup (FIXED).** The real cause is a bug in **parse-js 8.6.0** `RESTController.js`: when a `progress` callback is passed to `Parse.File.save()` (OpenSign always does), the SDK calls `response.body.getReader()` (locking the stream) *before* checking `Content-Length`, then — when it reads `Content-Length` as `0` — calls `response.json()` on the now-locked body → `Failed to execute 'json' on 'Response': body stream is locked`. `Content-Length` is **not** readable cross-origin unless exposed, and even when exposed browsers don't reliably surface it, so our **split-origin** deployment (app on `opensign.bettersign.ing`, API on `*.fly.dev`) makes the SDK always take the buggy `length === 0` branch. Same-origin OpenSign (hosted) reads `Content-Length` fine, so it never trips — that's why it's upstream-latent. **Fix:** `apps/OpenSign/patches/parse+8.6.0.patch` (via `patch-package`, wired into `postinstall`) moves `getReader()` into the `length > 0` branch so the `length === 0` path can `response.json()` on an unlocked body. Verified in-browser (repro throws; patched logic returns the file URL) and the live bundle serves the patched chunk. The same bug exists in `ParseFile.download` but OpenSign doesn't use that path, so it's left alone.
12. **Public file uploads are enabled** (`index.js` → `fileUpload.enableForPublic`). OpenSign's frontend saves `Parse.File` objects without a session token and doesn't hydrate `Parse.User.current()`. Parse Server's secure default (`enableForPublic:false`) rejects unauthenticated uploads with code 130; enabling public uploads matches OpenSign's hosted config so anonymous/guest flows work. Trade-off: anyone who can reach the API can POST files to storage. Set the Fly secret `FILE_UPLOAD_PUBLIC=false` to lock it back down.
13. **BetterSign (phone sign + login) — integrated; `docsign` origin only.** This fork ships a BetterSign integration (sign a field / log in via phone) that calls a separate coordinator Worker (`bs-opensign-sign`, in your own `bs-opensign` project — not this repo). OpenSign-side wiring is complete: frontend components (`PhoneSign.jsx`, `BetterSignLogin.jsx`), the `bettersignlogin` cloud fn, and the `BS_LOGIN_SECRET` Fly secret are all present.
    - **"failed to fetch" root cause (FIXED): the coordinator Worker URL was never baked into the deployed bundle.** `REACT_APP_BS_SIGN_URL` was added to `apps/OpenSign/.env` *after* the frontend had already been built/deployed, and there's no runtime `window.RUNTIME_ENV`, so `signBaseUrl()` resolved to `""` and the signing/login fetches never reached the Worker. Fix: rebuild with the env var present (verified the URL is now baked into the live chunks) and redeploy. **Any change to `apps/OpenSign/.env` requires a frontend rebuild + redeploy** — these values are compile-time, not runtime.
    - **Origin constraint:** the Worker's CORS `ALLOWED_ORIGIN` is `https://docsign.bettersign.ing`, so signing/login only work from that origin. `docsign` is therefore the single canonical URL and `opensign.bettersign.ing` 301-redirects to it (Cloudflare Page Rule + a proxied `A 192.0.2.1` DNS record for opensign so the rule can fire — a Worker custom domain would otherwise intercept before the rule).
    - **Remaining operational gotchas, on the Worker/phone side (not this repo):** (a) the signer's phone must be **registered** in the BetterSign app first, else `start` returns `404 "No BetterSign device registered…"` (this is the current expected response for an unregistered test number); (b) the Worker's `VERIFIER_SECRET` must be set or `poll` never reaches `authorized`. To allow another signing origin later, update `ALLOWED_ORIGIN` in the `bs-opensign` Worker and redeploy it.

## 7. Operations runbook

All commands assume the repo root. Secret values live in `DEPLOYMENT-SECRETS.local.txt`.

### Redeploy the frontend after a code change
```bash
# 1. Build the SPA with the baked-in API URL (apps/OpenSign/.env already set)
cd apps/OpenSign && npm run build && cd -

# 2. Deploy the static assets (clean dir avoids cf's Vite auto-detection)
rm -rf /tmp/docsign-site && mkdir -p /tmp/docsign-site
cp -R apps/OpenSign/build /tmp/docsign-site/build
cp deploy/cloudflare-frontend/{cloudflare.config.ts,wrangler.config.ts,package.json} /tmp/docsign-site/
cd /tmp/docsign-site && npm install && cf deploy
```

### Redeploy / restart the backend
```bash
cd apps/OpenSignServer && fly deploy --ha=false        # rebuild + roll
fly logs  --app docsign-bettersign-api                 # tail logs
fly status --app docsign-bettersign-api
```

### Rotate or add backend secrets
```bash
fly secrets set KEY=value --app docsign-bettersign-api   # triggers a redeploy
```

### Enable email (example: SMTP)
```bash
fly secrets set SMTP_ENABLE=true SMTP_HOST=... SMTP_PORT=465 \
  SMTP_USER_EMAIL=... SMTP_USERNAME=... SMTP_PASS=... \
  --app docsign-bettersign-api
```
Note: the `files/` email templates are shadowed by the volume mount. To use email,
either move the files mount to a dedicated path (e.g. mount at `/data` and set a custom
`filesSubDirectory`) or copy the templates onto the volume.

### Enable the document signing certificate
```bash
fly secrets set PFX_BASE64="$(base64 -i your-cert.p12)" PASS_PHRASE="..." \
  --app docsign-bettersign-api
```

### Cut backend cost with scale-to-zero (optional)
In `apps/OpenSignServer/fly.toml` set `auto_stop_machines = "suspend"` and
`min_machines_running = 0`, then `fly deploy`. First request after idle incurs a cold start.
(Keep the Mongo app always-on — it has no HTTP trigger to wake it.)

### Swap Mongo for MongoDB Atlas M0 (free, optional)
Create an Atlas M0 cluster, allow Fly egress IPs, then:
```bash
fly secrets set MONGODB_URI="mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster/opensign?retryWrites=true&w=majority" \
  --app docsign-bettersign-api
# then: fly apps destroy docsign-bettersign-mongo
```

### Add a branded API domain later (optional)
Use a **one-label** host like `docsign-api.bettersign.ing` (covered by the universal cert):
`fly certs add docsign-api.bettersign.ing --app docsign-bettersign-api`, add a DNS-only
(grey-cloud) CNAME → `docsign-bettersign-api.fly.dev`, then rebuild the frontend with
`REACT_APP_SERVERURL=https://docsign-api.bettersign.ing/app` and update the backend
`SERVER_URL` secret to match.

---

## 8. Reproducing from scratch

Prereqs: `cf` authenticated (`cf auth whoami`), `flyctl` authenticated (`fly auth whoami`),
the `bettersign.ing` zone in the Cloudflare account.

1. **Generate secrets:** `APP_ID` (12 hex), `MASTER_KEY` (strong random), Mongo user/pass.
2. **Mongo app:** `fly apps create docsign-bettersign-mongo`; `fly volumes create mongo_data --size 1 --region sjc`; `fly secrets set MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME/PASSWORD --stage`; deploy with `deploy/fly-mongo/fly.toml` (command must include `--ipv6`).
3. **Backend app:** `fly apps create docsign-bettersign-api`; `fly volumes create opensign_files --size 1 --region sjc`; set secrets `APP_ID`, `MASTER_KEY`, `MONGODB_URI` (`...@docsign-bettersign-mongo.internal:27017/opensign?authSource=admin`), `SERVER_URL`; `cd apps/OpenSignServer && fly deploy`.
4. **Frontend:** write `apps/OpenSign/.env` (`REACT_APP_SERVERURL`, `REACT_APP_APPID`); `npm install && npm run build`; deploy per §7 using `deploy/cloudflare-frontend/`; the `domains` key wires `docsign.bettersign.ing`.

### `cf` CLI gotchas (beta) learned here
- `cf` uses **Workers Static Assets**, not legacy Pages. Deploy with `cf deploy`.
- Config is split: **`wrangler.config.ts`** = build options (`assetsDirectory`); **`cloudflare.config.ts`** = worker/deploy options (`name`, `compatibilityDate`, `assets.notFoundHandling`, `domains`).
- Custom domains = `worker.domains: string[]` (not `routes`). `triggers` is for event handlers (`fetch`/`scheduled`/`queue`/`email`), not domains.
- Deploy from a directory **without** `vite.config.js`/app `package.json`, or `cf` tries to re-detect the framework and rebuild (the app's `@cloudflare/vite-plugin` path fails).
